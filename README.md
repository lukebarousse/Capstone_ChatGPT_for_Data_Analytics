# What are the most optimal skills for a data nerd? 🤓
Using ChatGPT, I was able to uncover the most optimal skills to learn as a data nerd based on real-time data science job posting data from [datanerd.tech](https://www.datanerd.tech)

The most optimal skills were determined by developing a metric that aggregates both the demand and salary of a given skill. 

Normalized Value= 
Max Value within Job Title−Min Value within Job Title
Value−Min Value within Job Title
​
 

And the skill multiplier can be calculated as:

Skill Multiplier
=
Normalized Skill Count
×
Normalized Median Salary
Skill Multiplier=Normalized Skill Count×Normalized Median Salary

The results of the research are detailed further below, with teh top 3 jobs highlighted here; showing that Python and SQL are not only the highest in demand 📈 but also some of the highest paid 🤑.
